# Kalculator Project üßÆ

This project implements a **Kalculator** class that acts as a calculator to perform various mathematical operations, along with a **KalculatorStudentTester** class to test its functionality. The project is designed for students to understand basic operations in object-oriented programming with Java.

## Files in the Repository üìÇ

- **Kalculator.java**: This file contains the core implementation of the Kalculator class, responsible for performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **KalculatorStudentTester.java**: This file contains the test cases to verify the correct implementation of the methods in the Kalculator class.

## Features üåü

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:  
  Performs basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  
- **Error Handling**:  
  Safeguards against invalid inputs, such as division by zero.

- **Testing with KalculatorStudentTester**:  
  A separate test class designed to ensure the correctness of each method in the Kalculator.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- **Java JDK 8+**: The project requires Java 8 or higher to compile and run.

## Installation and Running ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   First, clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-link]
   ```

2. **Compile the files**:  
   Use the following command to compile the `Kalculator.java` and `KalculatorStudentTester.java` files.
   ```bash
   javac Kalculator.java KalculatorStudentTester.java
   ```

3. **Run the tests**:  
   Once compiled, run the `KalculatorStudentTester` class to see the test results.
   ```bash
   java KalculatorStudentTester
   ```

## Example Usage üìä

Here‚Äôs a brief example of how you can use the **Kalculator** class:

```java
Kalculator myKalculator = new Kalculator();
myKalculator.add(10, 5); // Outputs 15
myKalculator.divide(20, 4); // Outputs 5
```

Test cases in **KalculatorStudentTester.java** will output the expected results after running.
